# AutoTest
1. Create a test plan (test suite) containing 5 test cases (tests) for new account registration at http://automationpractice.com

Send a prioritized list of these test cases with their description and explain why you chose these 5 test cases in this priority order;

2. Automate 2 test cases from your test plan and explain why exactly those tests were chosen for automation. In automation use: Java, TestNG and Selenium Webdriver. Please use Maven for project assembling. All automated tests should be stable (can be executed multiple times without false failures\issues.)
